# Test Notebook

This is a static notebook-like page created with Markdown and code blocks.

## Section 1: Introduction
Hereâ€™s some explanatory text written in Markdown. You can include equations using LaTeX if your theme supports it (e.g., via MathJax):

$$ E = mc^2 $$

## Section 2: Python Code Example
Below is a "code cell" showing a simple Python script:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage
x = 5
y = 3
result = calculate_sum(x, y)
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {result}")
```
